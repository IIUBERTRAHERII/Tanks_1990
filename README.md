Code prvide the clone of game "Tanks 1990". This game was made by student of INRTU for course project of second year learning OOP. 
There are two game modes. The first is a classic mode that was in game. Second is a global mode with Big map. 
Unfotunately, I dont draw good maps. There is only one level. You can find .lvl files and draw maps by yourself. 

You can see the jdbc file. it need to be download for programm work. You should initialize it in this code for starting.
